<h2>
  <strong>Dear Eileen</strong>,
</h2>

<p>
  Thank you for your recent application to join us at the <a href="#">Faculty of Science at Université Génialissime</a> to<br />
  study for your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
</p>

<h2>
  Start dates
</h2>

<p>
  We are happy that you can start your studies with us at any time, but we prefer that you start at the<br />
  beginning of a semester; the start dates for each semester are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>First semester: September 9, 2016</li>
  <li>Second semester: January 15, 2017</li>
  <li>Third semester: May 2, 2017</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Please let me know if this is right for you, and if so, which start date you prefer.<br /> 
  You can find more information about important university dates on <a href="#">our website.</a>
</p>

<h2>
  Study subjects
</h2>

<ol>
  <li>In the Faculty of Genius Sciences, we have a great openness in research, as long as the subjects fall<br />
  within the field of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent and dedicated researcher, just the<br />
  kind of person we would like to have on our team. That said, among the ideas you submitted, the ones<br />
  that intrigued us the most are the following, in order of priority:
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
  Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>0<sub>3</sub>).<br />
  Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures above 30°C (86°F), when<br /> audience size increases exponentially (effect from 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)<br />
  Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Can you provide us with more information on each of these topics, including the expected duration of the<br />
  research, the staff and other resources needed, and anything else we should know? Thank you.
</p>

<p>
  Please accept, Madam, the expression of my distinguished sentiments,
</p>

<p>
